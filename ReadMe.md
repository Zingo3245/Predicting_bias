# Loaded Topics: Predicting bias through story selection and word choice
There has been a lot of talk about bias in the news media but it can be hard to figure out which media is truly biased. This project attempted to create a way of rating bias in news sources. Scrapping 550 articles from the internet, NLTK was used to analyize the words in the news articles which were sepereated into clusters. The clusters were able to correlate with their respective sources.
